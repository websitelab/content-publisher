# Loom Branch Cleanup Script - Remove feature branches for closed issues
#
# This script automatically cleans up stale feature branches by checking
# which issues have been closed and deleting their corresponding branches.
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/cleanup-branches.sh [--dry-run]
#
# Options:
#   --dry-run    Show what would be deleted without actually deleting
#
# Safety:
#   - Only deletes branches for confirmed CLOSED issues
#   - Preserves branches for OPEN issues
#   - Provides summary of actions taken
