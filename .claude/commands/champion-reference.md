# Champion: Reference Documentation

This file contains edge cases, complete workflow scripts, and troubleshooting information for the Champion role. **Reference this file when handling non-standard situations.**

---

## Edge Cases and Special Scenarios

This section documents how Champion handles non-standard situations during PR auto-merge.

### Edge Case 1: PR with No CI Checks

**Scenario**: Repository has no CI/CD configured, or PR doesn't trigger any checks.

**Handling**:
```bash
# gh pr checks returns "no checks reported"
if echo "$CHECKS" | grep -q "no checks reported"; then
  echo "PASS: No CI checks required"
  # Continue to merge
fi
```

**Decision**: **Allow merge** - absence of CI is not a blocker.

**Rationale**: Many repositories don't use CI, or use rulesets without status checks.

---

### Edge Case 2: PR with Pending CI Checks

**Scenario**: CI checks are queued or in progress when Champion evaluates the PR.

**Handling**:
```bash
# Check for pending/running checks
PENDING=$(echo "$CHECKS" | jq -r '.[] | select(.status == "IN_PROGRESS" or .status == "QUEUED") | .name')
if [ -n "$PENDING" ]; then
  echo "SKIP: CI checks still running - will retry next iteration"
  # Skip this PR, try again later
fi
```

**Decision**: **Skip and defer** - do not merge, check again in next iteration.

**Rationale**: Wait for CI to complete to ensure quality. Champion will naturally retry on next cycle (10 minutes).

---

### Edge Case 3: Force-Push After Judge Approval

**Scenario**: Builder force-pushes new commits after Judge added `loom:pr` label.

**Handling**:
- **Recency check** catches this (PR updated recently)
- **CI check** re-runs after force push
- **Judge approval remains valid** if PR still has `loom:pr` label

**Decision**: **Allow merge if all criteria pass** - recency and CI checks provide sufficient safety.

**Recommended improvement**: Judge should remove `loom:pr` on force-push (not Champion's responsibility).

---

### Edge Case 4: Merge Conflicts Develop After Approval

**Scenario**: PR was mergeable when Judge approved, but another PR merged first causing conflicts.

**Handling**:
```bash
MERGEABLE=$(gh pr view "$PR_NUMBER" --json mergeable --jq -r '.mergeable')
if [ "$MERGEABLE" != "MERGEABLE" ]; then
  echo "FAIL: Merge conflicts detected"
  # Add comment explaining conflict
  gh pr comment "$PR_NUMBER" --body "Cannot auto-merge: merge conflicts with base branch"
fi
```

**Decision**: **Skip and comment** - do not merge, notify via comment.

**Rationale**: Conflicts require human/Builder resolution. Champion should not attempt to resolve conflicts.

**Next steps**: Builder or Doctor should resolve conflicts and re-request Judge review.

---

### Edge Case 5: Stale PR (Updated > 24 Hours Ago)

**Scenario**: PR has `loom:pr` label but hasn't been updated in over 24 hours.

**Handling**:
```bash
HOURS_AGO=$(( (NOW_TS - UPDATED_TS) / 3600 ))
if [ "$HOURS_AGO" -gt 24 ]; then
  echo "FAIL: Stale PR (updated $HOURS_AGO hours ago)"
  # Skip merge, add comment
fi
```

**Decision**: **Skip and comment** - do not merge stale PRs.

**Rationale**: Main branch may have evolved significantly. Stale PRs should be rebased or re-reviewed.

**Recommended action**: Remove `loom:pr` label on stale PRs, request rebase from Builder.

---

### Edge Case 6: PR Modifying Only Test Files

**Scenario**: PR changes only test files (e.g., `*.test.ts`, `*.spec.rs`).

**Handling**: No special handling needed - standard safety criteria apply.

**Decision**: **Allow merge if criteria pass** - test-only changes are safe.

**Rationale**: Size limit (configurable, default 200 lines) and CI checks provide sufficient protection.

---

### Edge Case 7: PR with `loom:manual-merge` Added Mid-Evaluation

**Scenario**: Human adds `loom:manual-merge` label while Champion is evaluating the PR.

**Handling**: Label check (#1) runs first, catches override immediately.

**Decision**: **Skip immediately** - respect human override.

**Rationale**: Champion re-fetches labels at start of each evaluation, race condition window is minimal.

---

### Edge Case 8: PR Linked to Multiple Issues

**Scenario**: PR body contains "Closes #123, Closes #456, Fixes #789".

**Handling**:
```bash
# Extract all linked issues
LINKED_ISSUES=$(gh pr view "$PR_NUMBER" --json body --jq '.body' | grep -Eo "(Closes|Fixes|Resolves) #[0-9]+" | grep -Eo "[0-9]+")

# Verify each issue closed after merge
for issue in $LINKED_ISSUES; do
  STATE=$(gh issue view "$issue" --json state --jq -r '.state')
  if [ "$STATE" != "CLOSED" ]; then
    echo "Warning: Issue #$issue not auto-closed, closing manually"
    gh issue close "$issue" --comment "Closed by PR #$PR_NUMBER (auto-merged by Champion)"
  fi
done
```

**Decision**: **Allow merge, verify all linked issues** - standard practice.

**Rationale**: GitHub auto-closes multiple issues, but verify and manually close if needed.

---

### Edge Case 9: PR with Mixed-State CI Checks

**Scenario**: Some checks pass, some pending, some skipped.

**Handling**:
```bash
# Any non-SUCCESS conclusion fails the check
FAILING=$(echo "$CHECKS" | jq -r '.[] | select(.conclusion != "SUCCESS" and .conclusion != null) | .name')
if [ -n "$FAILING" ]; then
  echo "FAIL: Some checks did not pass"
fi
```

**Decision**: **Fail if any check is not SUCCESS** - conservative approach.

**Rationale**: "Skipped" or "Neutral" conclusions indicate incomplete validation.

---

### Edge Case 10: Critical File Pattern Extensions

**Scenario**: Repository adds new critical files not in pattern list (e.g., `auth.config.ts`).

**Handling**: Champion uses hardcoded patterns - will **not** catch new critical files.

**Decision**: **Requires pattern update** - human must extend `CRITICAL_PATTERNS` array.

**Maintenance**: Review and update critical file patterns periodically as codebase evolves.

**Recommended**: Add repository-specific `.loom/champion-critical-files.txt` for custom patterns (future enhancement).

---

### Edge Case 11: PR Size Exactly at Limit

**Scenario**: PR has exactly the configured limit of lines changed (e.g., if limit is 200: 100 additions + 100 deletions).

**Handling**:
```bash
SIZE_LIMIT=$(jq -r '.champion.auto_merge_max_lines // 200' .loom/config.json 2>/dev/null || echo 200)
if [ "$TOTAL" -gt "$SIZE_LIMIT" ]; then  # Strictly greater than
  echo "FAIL: Too large"
fi
```

**Decision**: **Allow merge** - limit is inclusive (<= configured limit allowed).

**Rationale**: PRs exactly at the limit are still considered acceptable for auto-merge purposes. The limit is configurable via `champion.auto_merge_max_lines` in `.loom/config.json` (default: 200). PRs can also bypass the size limit entirely with the `loom:auto-merge-ok` label.

---

### Edge Case 12: GitHub API Rate Limiting

**Scenario**: Champion makes too many API calls and hits rate limit.

**Handling**: `gh` commands will fail with rate limit error.

**Current behavior**: Error handling workflow catches this, adds comment to PR, continues.

**Recommendation**: Add exponential backoff or skip iteration if rate-limited (future enhancement).

---

### Edge Case 13: PR Approved by Multiple Judges

**Scenario**: Multiple agents or humans add comments/approvals to the same PR.

**Handling**: No special handling - `loom:pr` label is single source of truth.

**Decision**: **Allow merge** - redundant approvals are harmless.

**Rationale**: Label-based coordination prevents duplicate merges.

---

### Edge Case 14: Follow-on Issue Creation

**Scenario**: Merged PR contains TODOs, FIXMEs, deferred scope sections, or review comments suggesting future work.

**Handling**:
```bash
# After merge, scan for follow-on indicators
# Stage 1: Extract TODO/FIXME from diff with file:line attribution
TODOS=$(gh pr diff "$PR_NUMBER" | awk '...')  # See champion-pr-merge.md

# Stage 2: Parse PR body for follow-on sections
FOLLOWON=$(echo "$PR_BODY" | sed -n '/^## Follow-on/,/^## /p')

# Stage 3: Parse review comments for deferred suggestions
NOTES=$(gh api repos/.../pulls/$PR_NUMBER/comments --jq '...')

# Stage 4: Apply threshold logic
# - 1+ critical (FIXME/HACK/XXX) -> always create
# - Explicit follow-on section -> always create
# - 3+ TODOs -> create consolidated
# - Otherwise -> skip (too noisy)

# Stage 5: Duplicate detection
EXISTING=$(gh issue list --search "Follow-on from PR #$PR_NUMBER")

# Stage 6: Create issue with proper linking
gh issue create --title "Follow-on: Work identified in PR #$PR_NUMBER" --label "$LABEL"
```

**Decision**: **Create follow-on issue if thresholds met** - captures future work.

**Rationale**: Prevents valuable context about follow-on work from being lost when PRs merge. TODOs in code, deferred scope items, and review suggestions become trackable issues.

**Threshold Logic**:

| Indicator | Threshold | Action |
|-----------|-----------|--------|
| Critical patterns (FIXME, HACK, XXX) | 1+ | Always create |
| Explicit follow-on section | Any | Always create |
| Standard TODOs | 3+ | Create consolidated |
| Below threshold | < 3 TODOs, no sections | Skip |

**Force Mode Behavior**:
- Normal mode: Create with `loom:curated` label (goes to Champion evaluation)
- Force mode: Create with `loom:issue` label (goes directly to Builder queue)

**Edge Cases Within Follow-on**:

1. **PR with no original issue**: Use PR title instead of issue title for context
2. **TODO without colon**: Pattern requires `TODO:` not just `TODO` to avoid false positives
3. **Multi-line TODOs**: Only first line captured, truncated at 200 chars
4. **Duplicate follow-on issue exists**: Search before creation, skip if found
5. **Force mode with no daemon state file**: Fall back to `loom:curated` label

| Multiple linked issues | Allow | Verify all closed |
| Mixed-state CI | Fail | Require all SUCCESS |
| Unknown critical file | Miss | Needs pattern update |
| Exactly at size limit | Allow | Limit is inclusive |

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**PR not merging despite passing all checks**
- Check if rulesets require additional approvals
- Verify GitHub API rate limits haven't been hit
- Check for webhook delays in GitHub's processing

**Issue not auto-closing after merge**
- Verify PR body uses correct format: "Closes #123" (not "closes issue #123")
- Check if issue is in the same repository
- Manual close may be needed for cross-repo references

**Blocked issues not unblocking**
- Verify dependency format: "Blocked by #123" or "Depends on #123"
- Check if all dependencies are truly closed
- Manual unblock may be needed for complex dependency patterns

**Worktree checkout errors**
- These are expected when running from a worktree
- Champion verifies merge via API, not exit code
- No action needed - merge still succeeds

### Debugging Commands

```bash
# Check PR merge status
gh pr view <number> --json state,mergeable,statusCheckRollup

# View linked issues
gh pr view <number> --json body --jq '.body' | grep -Eo "(Closes|Fixes|Resolves) #[0-9]+"

# Check daemon state
cat .loom/daemon-state.json | jq '.force_mode'

# List blocked issues
gh issue list --label "loom:blocked" --state open

# Check API rate limit
gh api rate_limit
```
